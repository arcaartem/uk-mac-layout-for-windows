# uk-mac-layout-for-windows

The UK keyboard layout on a MacBook Pro is slighltly different than the UK Keyboard layout provided on Windows so when running Windows in a VM on Mac, some keys would be misaligned.

This layout file aims to resolve that by remapping ``` \ ```, ``` ` ```, and ``` ยง ``` keys on Windows to reflect their correct position on the MacBook keyboard.

### Install

- Download binaries [here](https://github.com/arcaartem/uk-mac-layout-for-windows/releases)
- Run ``` setup.exe ```
- Select the new layout in 'Control Panel'
